# We use the || operator to return an array of nil values if cookies.signed[:remember_me] itself is nil. The nil array is used to prevent causing spurious test breakage.
#		end
end

# The * operator allows us to use a two-element array as an argument to a method expecting two variables. 
# cookies.signed[:remember_me] returns an array of two elements, but we want the 'authenticate_with_salt' method to take two arguments, so that it can be invoked with 'User.authenticate_with_salt(id, salt)'


# Each element in the cookie is itself a hash of two elements, a value and an optional expires date.
# For example, we could implement user signin by placing a cookie with value equal to the userâ€™s id that expires 20 years from now:
#	cookies[:remember_token] = { :value => user.id, :expires => 20.years.from_now.utc }
# We could then retrieve the user with code like 
# 	User.find_by_id(cookies[:remember_token])
